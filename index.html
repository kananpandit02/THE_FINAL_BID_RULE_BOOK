<div class="card" id="affiliation">
  <h2>Event Affiliation</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>THE FINAL BID</strong> is an officially conducted event under
    <strong>PERCEPTRON 2026</strong>, the annual techno-cultural fest.
  </p>

  <p>
    The event is organized and managed in collaboration with the
    <strong>Department of Computer Science</strong>, ensuring a structured,
    fair, and competitive environment that blends strategic thinking with
    real-world sports analytics.
  </p>

  <p>
    All rules, evaluations, and final decisions are governed by the
    <strong>PERCEPTRON 2026 Organizing Committee</strong>, and the event
    adheres strictly to the official guidelines laid out in the auction
    rule book listed below.
  </p>
</div>



<!-- ================= DETAILED OVERVIEW ================= -->
<div class="card" id="overview">
  <h2>Event Overview</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>THE FINAL BID</strong> is a flagship strategic cricket auction
    simulation event conducted as part of <strong>PERCEPTRON 2026</strong>.
    The event is designed to replicate the intensity, complexity, and
    decision-making challenges of a real-world professional cricket league
    auction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Participants take on the role of franchise management teams and compete
    in a <strong>live, offline, open-bidding auction</strong> to build a
    complete cricket squad from a predefined player pool. Each decision made
    during the auction directly affects team balance, budget sustainability,
    and final scoring outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The primary objective of the event is to evaluate participants on
    <strong>strategic planning, cricketing knowledge, analytical ability,
    financial management, risk assessment, and real-time adaptability</strong>
    under strict constraints and competitive pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Teams must carefully manage a fixed auction purse while ensuring
    compliance with mandatory squad composition rules, overseas player limits,
    and role-based requirements. Aggressive bidding without foresight can
    compromise squad balance, while overly conservative strategies may result
    in missed opportunities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike conventional quizzes or games, <strong>THE FINAL BID</strong>
    rewards long-term vision over individual picks. Teams must anticipate
    opponent behavior, assess player value beyond base price, and plan for
    both the final 15-player squad and the optimal Playing XI.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the auction concludes, teams submit their Playing XI, captain, and
    wicketkeeper selections. Final scores are calculated using a
    <strong>points-based evaluation system</strong> that includes base player
    performance values and hidden strategic bonuses.
  </p>

  <p>
    The team with the highest total points is declared the winner, followed by
    the runner-up and third-place teams. In the event of a tie, predefined
    tie-breaking criteria are applied to ensure fair and transparent results.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>THE FINAL BID</strong> is not merely an auction—it is a test of
    leadership, strategy, and decision-making under pressure, offering
    participants a realistic experience of franchise-level cricket management.
